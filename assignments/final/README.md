# Nia Brown's Final Project

1. TITLE: Nia's Generative Art Gallery

Each portrait/artwork has it's own unique behavior. From left to right:

Portrait 1:  Dynamic Audio Visualizer

Displays a colorful and dynamic audio visualizer that responds to pre-recorded audio files. The shapes and colors  change based on the audio input. Users can interact with the visualizer by adjusting the audio playback speed with mouse movements.

Portrait 2: Fractal Garden

Plants and flowers are generated using fractal algorithms. Users can interact with the garden by planting seeds or adjusting parameters, causing the plants to grow and change over time.

Portrait 3: Particle Symphony

Develop a visual and auditory symphony of particles that move and collide in response to music or sound input. Users can change the music to influence the particles' behavior, creating unique patterns and movements.

Portrait 4: Perlin Noise

Generate portraits of people using Perlin noise. The portraits could morph and shift over time, creating a sense of movement and transformation. Users can interact with the portraits by adjusting sliders that control the intensity and direction of the noise.

Portrait 5: Skyline

The buildings and streets are generated using cellular automata. User can change the rules of the automata or introduce random events to see how the city evolves and grows.
